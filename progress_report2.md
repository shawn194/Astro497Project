For the second checkpoint, I made sure that I could successfully run a basic linear modela and a linear + sinusoidal model on the cleaned dataset from checkpoint 1.  
Currently, I have the code (mostly taken from lab 4) to create the models, and the next major step for me is to work on visualization.  
I need to visualize the linear + sinusoidal model and I also want to figure out a way to visualize multiple datasets together (work in progress).  
Since I am working by myself, I am working at my own pace, but I should have a lot of time over the upcoming break to work on this project.
