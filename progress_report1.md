For the first checkpoint, I focused on making sure I could read in the data and also perform the necessary data wranglings steps.
The overall dataset I used didn't have any missing values, but once I started analyzing each KOI individually I wrote code to manually
remove transit numbers that were more than two standard deviations from the mean. I also made it so that any of the KOIs can be analyzed by manually
typing in the KOI into a text box in the Pluto notebook.  
Currently, I am at a point where the next step I have to take is to make preliminary models. These models for me will be simple linear models, and then I will another set that are more complex. I anticipate that the next steps will be more complex so I will allocate more time in the upcoming two weeks to work on this project.
